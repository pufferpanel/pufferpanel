#What is PufferPanel?
PufferPanel is a web-based Game Server Management System created by players for players. PufferPanel allows you to manage multiple different game servers all from one central location, and give other users their own servers, or access to your own servers. You can find pictures of our interfaces in our [General User Feature Tour](http://www.pufferpanel.com/docs/general-user-feature-tour) or in our [Administrative Feature Tour](http://www.pufferpanel.com/docs/administrative-feature-tour).

#Open Source
PufferPanel has been and will always be committed to being free and open-source software. All of our projects are available on our Github Account and we welcome any user to submit ideas or code. Being licensed under a GPL-v3 license means that you are welcome to runs PufferPanel in a commercial (for-profit) environment or make any changes to the system that you see fit.

#Why Create PufferPanel
We set out to create PufferPanel to fill a hole in the Game Server industry. There are very few free and open-source game management panels out there, and we wanted to be the best. There are many users who simply cannot afford to shell out money on expensive management panels just to run a few personal servers, or want to use a system that restricts them from making modifications to suit their needs. PufferPanel changes all of this by providing a simple interface that can support multiple game types and keeps things simple and non-bloated.

#Why Use PufferPanel
PufferPanel offers you a no-hassle solution for managing your game servers at both a personal and a commercial level. By keeping all of our code open-source we allow anyone to submit ideas and features directly to the panel. In addition, you can browse through everything and submit bug reports and fixes as you find and patch them without having to wait on someone else to fix and release a new version.

Best of all? It's free.

# Special Thanks
* **[FontAwesome.io](http://fontawesome.io)** — Mad props to the people who created this wonderful open-source icon-set that we take advantage of in PufferPanel.
* **[puffrfish](https://github.com/puffrfish)** — A very special thank you to puffrfish who had the idea almost two years ago to create PufferPanel for a hosting buisness. Without his reassurance, ideas, and determination this panel never would have made it off the ground and gotten to the point it has made it.
* **[LordRalex](https://github.com/LordRalex)** — without LordRalex this project would ot be where it is today. By offering countless hours of his time to the project he has helped fix many bugs and design issues within the entire panel, as well as developed the first automatic installer for the panel.
* **[Koo](https://github.com/koo04)** – Koo has provided countless hours helping to fix GSD (when we used it) and contribute code and ideas to the team. Without his determination and help PufferPanel and Scales would not exist as they are today.
